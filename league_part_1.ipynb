    "\n",
    "In this project, you will look at a large data set of information on players and teams from over 10,000 *League of Legends* competitive matches. There are many questions that can be answered using this data, such as:\n",
    "- Looking at [tier one professional leagues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_League_of_Legends_leagues_and_tournaments), which league has the most \"action-packed\" games? Is the amount of \"action\" in this league significantly different than in other leagues? Note that you'll have to come up with a way of quantifying \"action\".\n",
    "- Which competitive region has the highest win rate against teams outside their region? Note you will have to find and merge region data for this question as the dataset does not have it.\n",
    "- Which role \"carries\" (does the best) in their team more often: ADCs (Bot lanes) or Mid laners?\n",
    "- Is (DSC 80 tutor) Costin's favorite champion (Talon) more likely to win or lose a match?\n",

    "# Summary of Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "On November 20th, 2019, the **Dragon soul system** was introduced to League of Legends. Simply speaking, Dragons are a neutral monster in the game that the two teams could compete for. The team which kills them could get buffs (beneficial boost) which can help them win the game. When a team kills their fourth dragon, they would get the Dragon soul, which is an even more powerful buff that **can offer a huge advantage to the team**. There are **six different types of dragons** (and one of them, chemtechs, was removed in the beginning of this year, so there are only five in the most part of this year), and each of them offers different buffs. **Dragon soul can only be gained once per game, meaning only one team can get it.**\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that League players sometimes discuss about dragons is that the Cloud Dragon soul's buff seems less useful than other Dragon souls based on the attributes they offer. Besides, according to the professional esport matches data, the average win rate of a team that gets Cloud Dragon souls is also lower than the average win rate of teams with other Dragon souls. To resolve this problem, the game patch 12.14 was released to adjust and balance the buffs offered by the various Dragons. **So is gaining Cloud Dragon soul really less helpful for the team to get victory than other Dragon souls? Or is it by random chance? If so, did the balance patch 12.14 fix this problem?** We will try to figure this out by the following data analysis steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cleaning and EDA\n",
    "The dataset downloaded from [Oracle's Elixir](https://oracleselixir.com/tools/downloads) website is kind of messy. There are 123 columns at total, so I removed most of the columns, and only kept the colums of some basic info, like the result, and those relevant to dragons, such as the numbers of each type of dragons in the match.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, most of the rows in the dataset is about each player's personal data, like thier killing and deaths. We only care about the dragon statistics, which is the team data. So we removed all the rows containing players' data. Another cleaning I did is convert the values of results, consisting of `1 (win) and 0 (lose)`, to `True and False`. Some of the matches have the number of each type of dragons missing, instead, they are stored together as the total dragon numbers, in a single column where their types are indistinguishable. In this EDA section, we just want to make some intuition about our data, so I temporarily ignored these missingness, and leave them to the next section. The final cleaning I did is to creat a new column with the type of Dragons souls stored as String, instead of having several columns with the number of each type of dragons.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my EDA process, I have the following findings: the average win rate of having the Cloud dragon soul is `67.44%`, whereas the overall win rate is `79.35%`. Also I found out that after rebalance patch 12.14, the Cloud soul win rate was increased to `100%`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assessment of Missingness\n",
    "Previously, we found out that some rows have missing value on the columns of number of dragons of each type, and instead the total numbers of dragons were stored in a column `dragon (type unknown)`. Personally, I think they are not NMAR, because it's not reasonable that the match organizer decided to not record the dragon types depending on the dragon types themselves. More possible explanations would be that the dragon types are not so important compared to other information, so they just did not record it.\n",
    "\n",
    "By doing permutation test, I got the p value of `0.058`. So I am pretty confident that the the missing in dragon types columns are not independent on the win rate. This implies the win rate and the missing has some kind of relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis Test\n",
    "By doing hypothesis test with the **Null hypothesis**: Cloud Dragon soul is as helpful as other Dragon souls, the differences on the win rate is due to random chance. The actual win rate after gaining a Cloud Dragon soul is the **same** as the overall mean win rate of gaining Dragon soul. And test statistics to be the mean, with p value of `0.04478`, I **failed to reject** the null hypothesis."
